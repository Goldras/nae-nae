Game should be grid based.

Clicking should be minimal; the player character should be able to start the game off by creating workers, but other than that everything
should have to be automated.

Framework/basic gameplay should be worked out before we start on the story.

Everything will have to be grounded in supply lines, from resources, to worker actions. The first factory will be able to produce a few 
basic worker commands freely, but every other worker factory, and any other command types will have to be produced through "presses." 
Additionally, the workers' abilities to read the amount of something will only be able to happen if they can touch the building itself, or,
with a bit of investment, a building with a limited radius. 

Upgrades should follow the same principle; outside of prestige upgrades, or additions to the buildings themselves, any upgrades given
should be a limited resource that also has to be produced. For example, if you want to upgrade worker lifespan, you have to deliver a 
resource to a worker-factory, which has a limited amount of uses. Each time a worker is created, the stack is reduced by one, with the 
worker having an increased lifespan. Basic worker upgrades should include resource collection speed, lifespan, and movement speed, but
more can be added as we figure things out.
